  <h1>Building Machine Learning Powered Applications</h1>
  <h2>Notes for Part I. Find the Correct ML Approach</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Start with product goal</strong>
  </p>  
    (1) framing your product goal in an ML paradigm: When we build a product, we start by thinking of what service we want to deliver to users.
    (2) evaluating the feasibility of that ML task. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    Narrow the ML approaches into different categories: 
    (1) Classification and regression
    (2) Knowledge extraction
    (3) Catalog organization
    (4) Generative models
  </p>
  
  <strong>How do you evaluate a successful product?</strong>
  <p>
    - Business performance: a clear feature goal
      e.g. recommendation system, how many people click it, and the recommendation is acutally useful to them

    - Model performance: actual evaluation in the code
      e.g. using cross-entropy, evaluating accuracy
      the product goal should be realistic so that the current method is able to implement

      Model metric and product metric should be coorporated.
  </p>

  <p>Start from simple rule as baseline, it is not always necessary to use ML</p>
  <p>
    - From export: How do people currently solve the problem you are trying to solve?
    - From exploratory data analysis: Based on your dataset, how would you solve this task if you were doing it manually?
  </p>
  <p>Utlize open data</p>
  <p>We can use a similar dataset, meaning a dataset with similar input and output types (but not necessarily domains). Then if 
    the model performs well, we can believe that it will perform well in the target dataset.
  </p>
  <p>Utilize open code</p>
  <p>Similar to your search for data, 
    a good way to find similar codebases is to abstract the problem to its input and output types 
    and find codebases tackling problems with similar types.</p>

  <p>Find open code, reproduce the results; find similar dataset, apply the model on that dataset; 
    iterate based on your model metrics.
  </p>
