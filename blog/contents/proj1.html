  <h1>From Model to Production</h1>

  <p>
    This project demonstrates the journey from a machine learning model to a production-ready application. 
    It is inspired by the book 
    <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD
    </a>, chapter 2, but adapted to use the PyTorch library.

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset for this project is sourced via DuckDuckGo.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The pretrained <code>resnet18</code> model was chosen and fine-tuned on this dataset. 
      Training was conducted in HPC interactive mode to leverage GPU acceleration. 
      All code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
